# Match Point
I WANT a site that lets users schedule sports events/get-togethers, casual or local professional.<br />
When visiting the site, the user is greeted with the option to log in, a rendered list of scheduled events, the option to host an event, filter/search events, and view their own calendar/planner of events they've signed up for.<br />
Site will need to use a calendar api or technology to store info, and sync it to the accounts of hosts and attendees.<br />
Possibly use Google Maps tool/api to let users see small map view of location for posted event.<br />
Additional tools and functions to be added later include Team/Org hosting, commenting, chatting, digital score cards.<br />
